# "Hikaru no Go" GBA Translation

[Homepage](http://www.ricbit.com/mundobizarro/hikaru.php)

## Usage

0. Install JDK.
1. Prepare your own ROM of the game, name it "hikago.gba", and place it in the same directory as Script.java.
2. `javac *.java`
3. `java Script hikago.xml insert`

## Understanding hikago.xml

### Text

Each `<text>` element in hikago.xml corresponds to one translated string. They may be organized under parent elements of arbitrary names, but the script only recursively looks for `<text>` elements and ignores everything else.

Pointers exist in the ROM. The `pointer` attribute of a `<text>` element gives the address of a **pointer** to the in-game string. For example, for this element:

```
<text pointer="2d52a0">1.Go is?</text>
```

The script will go to `0x002d52a0` of the ROM:

```
002d52a0  1C 54 2D 08 29 54 2D 08  3D 54 2D 08 36 54 2D 08
```

Read 4 bytes in little endian (`0x082d541c`), subtract `0x08000000` from it, and get pointer `0x002d541c`. This is where the string actually starts.

Strings in ROM are terminated by one byte of `0x0`. In cases where the translated string is longer than the original string, the script will write the translated string to the end of ROM (bytes `0x7fade0` ~ `0x7fffff` are unused), and then overwrite the pointer.

## Code structure

- `class TextBlock`: one `TextBlock` object corresponds to one `<text>` element in hikago.xml, and contains an array of `TextLine` objects.
- `class TextLine`: one `TextLine` object corresponds to one line of in-game text, and contains an array of java strings.
- `class Script`: the main class, it reads data from files, processes them, applies the translation to hikago.gba, and writes the result to _hikago.gba.
- `class ControlString`: one `ControlString` object corresponds to one special control string in hikago.xml, such as "@NAME@".
