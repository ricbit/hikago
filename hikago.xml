          <text pointer="2d59c8">Sai "Go is a 2-player game using a board &amp; stones.</text>
          <text pointer="2d59ec">Black and white play alternatively, and who takes more territory wins.</text>
          <text pointer="2d5a18">Boards may be 9x9,</text>
          <text pointer="2d5a34">13x13,</text>
          <text pointer="2d5a50">or 19x19.</text>
          <text pointer="2d5a78">Sai "Whatever size, the rules are the same.</text>
          <text pointer="2d5ab4">Hikaru "To beginners like @NAME@, I suggest starting with 9x9.</text>
          <text pointer="2d5af8">Sai "Right. 9x9 is smaller, thus easier to understand.</text>
          <text pointer="2d5b1c">Next, the stones.</text>
          <text pointer="2d5b5c">Stones come in black and white, one for each player.</text>
          <text pointer="2d5b6c">Stones are played on intersections.</text>
          <text pointer="2d5bac">They can also be played on the @RED@edges@ENDCOLOR@.</text>
          <text pointer="2d5bd8">Like this.</text>
          <text pointer="2d5c20">Or on the @RED@corners@ENDCOLOR@ like this.</text>
          <text pointer="2d5c68">Sai "A game proceeds by black and white playing alternatively.</text>
        </chapter1_1>
        <chapter1_2>
          <text pointer="2d689c">Sai "In go, the player with more territory wins.</text>
          <text pointer="2d68d8">For example, these black stones surround some territory for black.</text>
          <text pointer="2d68e8">Such territory is called @RED@ji@ENDCOLOR@.</text>
          <text pointer="2d68f8">The unit of ji is @RED@moku@ENDCOLOR@.</text>
          <text pointer="2d6908">To count ji, count surrounded intersections, not the stones.</text>
          <text pointer="2d69b4">Here, black has 3 moku.</text>
          <text pointer="2d6a30">Sai "Question.</text>
          <text pointer="2d6a64">How many moku does white have?</text>
          <text pointer="2d72dc">Choose moku for white</text>
          <text pointer="2d7954">6 moku</text>
          <text pointer="2d7958">16moku</text>
          <text pointer="2d795c">20moku</text>
          <text pointer="2d7988">Correct! Good work! Let's count.</text>
          <text pointer="2d79b8">Sorry, that's not correct. Let's count together.</text>
          <text pointer="2d6b8c">Like that, 6 moku is correct.</text>
          <text pointer="2d6bc0">Next, how to count ji on the edges.</text>
          <text pointer="2d6cdc">Like that, black has 6 moku.</text>
          <text pointer="2d6d8c">How many moku does white have?</text>

          <text pointer="2d79ec">8 moku</text>
          <text pointer="2d6e38">Like that, 3 moku is correct.</text>
          <text pointer="2d6e6c">Next, how to count ji on the corners.</text>
          <text pointer="2d6f10">Like that, black has 3 moku.</text>
          <text pointer="2d6f5c">Hikaru "Alright, try this one.</text>
          <text pointer="2d6f90">How many moku does white have?</text>
          <text pointer="2d7a74">6 moku</text>
          <text pointer="2d7a78">9 moku</text>
          <text pointer="2d7a7c">15moku</text>
          <text pointer="2d7aa8">Correct! Sai, let's count together.</text>
          <text pointer="2d7ad8">Incorrect! Sai, show them.</text>
          <text pointer="2d70b8">Sai "Like that, 6 moku is correct.</text>
          <text pointer="2d7128">Sai "Use edges and corners to take more territory with fewer stones.</text>
          <text pointer="2d714c">Remember not to count the stones.</text>
        </chapter1_2>
        <chapter1_3>
          <text pointer="2d8694">Sai "Capture opponent stones by surrouding them with your stones.</text>
          <text pointer="2d86b8">Let's see some capturing in action.</text>
          <text pointer="2d871c">I play black. First, look at this white stone.</text>
          <text pointer="2d8740">It has 4 intersections adjacent to it.</text>
          <text pointer="2d8750">When black plays on all 4, the white stone is captured.</text>
          <text pointer="2d8788">That is, when opponent stones have no way to escape, they are captured.</text>
          <text pointer="2d87e0">It's the same with more than 1 stone.</text>
          <text pointer="2d8870">Sai "Now let's capture on the edge.</text>
          <text pointer="2d88d4">Like before, looking at intersections...</text>
          <text pointer="2d88f0">There are 3 adjacent to the stone.</text>
          <text pointer="2d8914">When black plays on all 3, the white stone is captured.</text>
          <text pointer="2d8988">It's the same with more than 1 stone.</text>
          <text pointer="2d8a1c">Hikaru "How about on the corner?</text>
          <text pointer="2d8a84">Like before, looking at intersections...</text>
          <text pointer="2d8ab0">Now there are only 2 adjacent to the stone, right?</text>
          <text pointer="2d8ac0">Black playing on both captures the white stone.</text>
          <text pointer="2d8b2c">Of course, the same with more than 1 stone.</text>
          <text pointer="2d8b64">So? Wherever you play, blocking opponent's escape is the same, right?</text>
          <text pointer="2d8bd0">Sai "Yeah, that's right.</text>
          <text pointer="2d8bf4">However, beginners may forget how to capture on edges and corners.</text>
          <text pointer="2d8c18">Also, don't just focus on capturing, also try to avoid being captured.</text>
          <text pointer="2d8c3c">Lastly, on how captured stones are used.</text>
          <text pointer="2d8c60">Captured stones are called @RED@prisoners@ENDCOLOR@.</text>
          <text pointer="2d8c84">Prisoners reduce your opponent's territory at end of games.</text>
        </chapter1_3>
        <chapter1_4>
          <text pointer="2da094">Sai "Before a game, play order and handicap are decided.</text>
          <text pointer="2da0b8">The order is called teban.</text>
          <text pointer="2da0dc">When black plays, it's called black's turn. Same with white's turn.</text>
          <text pointer="2da100">A game begins at black's turn.</text>
          <text pointer="2da140">To decide play order, since the first player has an advantage,</text>
          <text pointer="2da150">usually the weaker player plays black, the stronger white.</text>
          <text pointer="2da170">When players differ in skill level, handicap can be applied.</text>
          <text pointer="2da180">Let's look at how to place handicap stones.</text>
          <text pointer="2da1a0">In a handicapped game, black begins with 2 or more stones.</text>
          <text pointer="2da1b0">This is very advantageous to black.</text>
          <text pointer="2da1cc">Number of stones is decided by difference in skill.</text>
          <text pointer="2da200">For an example, look at this game.</text>
          <text pointer="2da210">Here, black gets 4 handicap stones.</text>
          <text pointer="2da220">These 4 stones count as 1 move, so it's white's turn next.</text>
          <text pointer="2da27c">If no handicap stones are placed, it's called an @RED@even game@ENDCOLOR@.</text>
          <text pointer="2da2a0">In even games, use @RED@nigiri@ENDCOLOR@ to decide sides.</text>
          <text pointer="2da2c4">One player grabs some stones, the other guesses odd or even.</text>
          <text pointer="2da2e8">Let's do a nigiri for real.</text>
          <text pointer="2da30c">Hikaru, please demonstrate nigiri.</text>
          <text pointer="2da378">Hikaru "OK, I'll nigiri!</text>
          <text pointer="2da9f8">Odd or even</text>
          <text pointer="2da60c">Correct! You take black.</text>
          <text pointer="2da630">Missed! I'll go black.</text>
          <text pointer="2da6a0">Sai "In an even game, after play order is decided,</text>
          <text pointer="2da6c4">since black has an advantage, a handicap, @RED@komi@ENDCOLOR@, is given to white.</text>
          <text pointer="2da6e8">Komi means additional territory.</text>
          <text pointer="2da70c">When komi is 5.5 moku, white starts the game with 5.5 moku.</text>
          <text pointer="2da730">Komi is not visible, and only takes effect when counting territory.</text>
          <text pointer="2da754">The half-moku also prevents draw games.</text>
          <text pointer="2da7c0">With handicaps, anyone can play together.</text>
        </chapter1_4>
        <chapter1_5>
          <text pointer="2db784">Sai "When neither player is able to gain any additional territory,</text>
          <text pointer="2db7a8">a game ends.</text>
          <text pointer="2db7cc">This is called @RED@shuukyoku@ENDCOLOR@.</text>
          <text pointer="2db7f0">Then, after counting, the one with more territory wins.</text>
          <text pointer="2db85c">Hikaru "If you find a game hopeless, you can also surrender.</text>
          <text pointer="2db880">In go, this is called to @RED@resign@ENDCOLOR@.</text>
          <text pointer="2db8a4">The resigning player loses regardless of territory.</text>
          <text pointer="2db910">Sai "Now, after a game ends, before territory is counted,</text>
          <text pointer="2db934">there are things that must be done.</text>
          <text pointer="2db97c">First, areas that belong to neither player are filled.</text>
          <text pointer="2db9d4">These intersections are called @RED@dame@ENDCOLOR@.</text>
          <text pointer="2db9fc">Then, dead opponent stones in your territory become prisoners.</text>
          <text pointer="2dbab4">Finally, put prisoners into opponent territory.</text>
          <text pointer="2dbb38">Hikaru "That's how prisoners reduce opponent territory.</text>
          <text pointer="2dbba4">Sai "Now we are almost ready to start counting...</text>
          <text pointer="2dbbd0">but the board is so messy it's difficult to count.</text>
          <text pointer="2dbbe0">So we move stones without affecting territory, to make it easier.</text>
          <text pointer="2dbd40">This is @RED@seichi@ENDCOLOR@.</text>
          <text pointer="2dbd94">Hikaru "See, this is easier, right?</text>
          <text pointer="2dbe00">Sai "Now we can finally count.</text>
          <text pointer="2dbe2c">Who wins in this game? Do you know?</text>
          <text pointer="2dcb18">Who wins</text>
          <text pointer="2dce34">Black</text>
          <text pointer="2dce38">White</text>

          <text pointer="2ea4e0">Observe that the 3 white stones are in atari again.</text>
          <text pointer="2ea504">So black now plays here to capture the 3 white stones.</text>
          <text pointer="2ea538">That is snapback.</text>
          <text pointer="2ea5a0">Hikaru "The first move sacrifices some stones.</text>

          <text pointer="2ead58">Correct!</text>
          <text pointer="2ead88">Incorrect. Let me explain.</text>
          <text pointer="2ea6d0">At A, black can play B and avoid capture.</text>
          <text pointer="2ea744">At B, black plays A to capture one stone,</text>
          <text pointer="2ea7a0">but white then captures 3 black stones.</text>

          <text pointer="2eb93c">Sai "I'll explain @RED@oiotoshi@ENDCOLOR@.</text>
          <text pointer="2eb960">Oiotoshi is to repeatedly atari until capture.</text>
          <text pointer="2eb984">It's a bit hard, but a very satisfying tesuji.</text>
          <text pointer="2eb9d4">For example, look at this board.</text>
          <text pointer="2eba10">Black plays here, atari.</text>
          <text pointer="2eba54">In defense, white plays here and captures black.</text>
          <text pointer="2ebaa0">From now on an oiotoshi starts.</text>
          <text pointer="2ebab0">First play here to atari white.</text>
          <text pointer="2ebaf4">White plays here to escape,</text>
          <text pointer="2ebb44">but black then plays here, capturing 6 white stones.</text>
          <text pointer="2ebb80">This is oiotoshi.</text>
          <text pointer="2ebbb0">But if black plays wrongly, the oiotoshi will fail.</text>
          <text pointer="2ebbd0">If black plays here,</text>
          <text pointer="2ebc04">then white plays here, connects and escapes.</text>
          <text pointer="2ebcb8">Even if black attempts to surround white,</text>
          <text pointer="2ebcfc">white can play here</text>
          <text pointer="2ebd40">to capture black and escape.</text>
          <text pointer="2ebd50">This is a failed oiotoshi.</text>
          <text pointer="2ebd60">To play oiotoshi, you must think several moves ahead.</text>
          <text pointer="2ebdc8">Hikaru "This is different from snapback.</text>

          <text pointer="2ebe28">White's turn. To capture black with oiotoshi, where should white play?</text>
          <text pointer="2ec1e8">Choose from A/B</text>
          <text pointer="2ec5f4">Correct! Good job.</text>
          <text pointer="2ec624">Hmm. Nope. It's hard, after all.</text>
          <text pointer="2ebe68">If white plays A,</text>
          <text pointer="2ebe9c">black can play B, and white cannot capture.</text>
          <text pointer="2ebef4">At B, despite losing 1 stone</text>
          <text pointer="2ebf48">white plays here</text>
          <text pointer="2ebf74">to capture black stones like this.</text>
          <text pointer="2ebf84">So B is correct.</text>
          <text pointer="2ebfe4">Hikaru "You can invade opponent territory despite their seeming eye.</text>

        <text pointer="2fb9a0">Sai "Both functions can be cancelled by pressing @BBUTTON@.</text>
